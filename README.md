[00:12.76] (yeah, DJ Krush in the house, the car-mel kingpin
[00:23.17] CL Smooth and only the strong survive)
[00:42.17] 
[00:37.36] Actual facts
[00:38.31] The ghetto reacts to warfare
[00:40.07] Real bullets miss you by your hair
[00:41.92] Survival of the fittest
[00:43.40] Hell for the three time losers
[00:45.24] The prisoners of enemy manuvers
[00:47.53] Hold down the fort
[00:48.47] Coz life is short enough to get it taken
[00:50.79] Forsaken when your mental planes' breakin
[00:52.50] Concealin' a 4 pound with every area
[00:55.11] We surround coz clown
[00:56.32] I get down for my crown
[00:58.23] Take it to the streets for the
[00:59.41] Honour and respect
[01:00.40] Connect the lethal
[01:01.36] Plus my young guns are unbeatable
[01:03.47] Aiding and abetting the foul
[01:05.14] Is a violation
[01:06.12] That's why my retalliation
[01:07.27] Is premeditation
[01:08.61] The invitation
[01:09.73] Is to run with a crew you can't do
[01:12.05] And too great to infiltrate from a
[01:13.65] Nickel plate
[01:14.52] I state
[01:15.35] This be the illest ever known on a rush
[01:18.09] Swervin' with the krush
[01:29.59] 
[01:23.13] (CL Smooth 2nd verse)
[01:41.46] Slip into the world of shiesty individuals
[01:43.75] A troubled man stalked by criminals
[01:46.09] Creeping through the city
[01:47.33] I step on the block to chat with
[01:49.27] Thugs from all the drugs for fatcat
[01:51.58] Stepping off the set now hand on my tool
[01:54.05] Thinking how bad I want to flip on that fool
[01:56.56] Times are wasting
[01:58.00] Chasing these punks for petty loot
[01:59.67] When there is a real mission to execute
[02:02.13] I put the plan in effect
[02:03.61] Forget what you heard
[02:05.18] When you get the word from 1st and 3rd
[02:07.16] For real I got the fam and all my soldiers to feed
[02:09.93] With the gunslingers on the block puffin' weed
[02:12.60] Envision the prison that I walk through
[02:14.55] Leaving any witness
[02:15.72] When I'm about to handle my business
[02:18.27] No escape from the duct tape and artillery
[02:20.31] Now tell me big man
[02:21.67] Where's the money ain't a damn thing funny
[02:42.67] 
[02:24.19] (CL Smooth 3rd verse)
[02:45.09] Cops play for medals
[02:46.28] Killers play for corners
[02:47.50] In the middle are your sons and are
[02:49.23] Your daughters
[02:49.81] Who gives the orders
[02:51.01] To chaos and mayhem
[02:52.59] Who has the proper guidance and mind to save them
[02:54.81] From this cold world of heartless ghetto dwellers
[02:57.75] Pimps, prostitutes, and dope sellers
[03:00.45] Strive to be the lead and not follow
[03:02.75] Ladies
[03:03.86] You can be the queens of tommorrow
[03:05.69] Dig it, I want all that and more
[03:07.52] For my peeps in the stuggle
[03:10.03] Food, clothing, and shelter
[03:11.73] Is essential
[03:12.39] To maintain the hardcore from the soft
[03:14.64] That pushed me to the edge but I can't fall off
[03:16.71] My battlegrounds keep the sound of babies crying
[03:19.42] Gunshots, and cursing
[03:20.44] Can you feel my reel
[03:22.18] Here's the deal
[03:23.18] By any means necessary
[03:24.66] Go all out
[03:25.49] And keep this alive
[03:26.54] Coz only the strong survive
